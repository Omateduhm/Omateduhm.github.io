<P><h2>Rapper Is Shot to Death in Echo of Killing 6 Months Ago
<p><h4>"Notorious B.I.G., a gangsta rap artist who turned his drug-dealing past on the streets of Brooklyn into a platinum-selling recording career, was killed here early this morning in an apparent drive-by shooting. He is the second big-name rapper to be slain in the last six months.

The victim, whose real name was Christopher G. Wallace, had left a crowded party and was sitting in a sport utility vehicle when a vehicle sped up and began spitting gunfire, witnesses said. A bystander rushed Mr. Wallace, 24, to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead, the police said."
