<p><h3 style="color:red;">"What happened with his cremation?
<p style="color:red;">Suge Knight claims he paid an astonishing $3 million for Tupac's cremation the day after he died. However the man who carried out the process allegedly disappeared and has never been seen again. There were also inconsistencies in the crematory process - for example Pac's social security number was not registered in the official death index."
<p>
<p style="color:red;">"Tupac's stage name Makaveli was a hint he planned to fake his death.
<p style="color:red;">Tupac also went by the stage name Makaveli – which was the same name as Italian strategist Niccolò Machiavelli who pretended to fake his death. Also, if you switch around the letters in Makaveli you get “Am Alive K”. Tupac’s ‘The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory’ album, was also released under that name and featured him as Jesus Christ on the cover – who came back after seven days."
<p>
<p style="color:red;">"Is Tupac still alive in Cuba?
There has been endless speculation about the possibility of both Biggie and Tupac still being alive. But could Pac still be alive in Cuba? A video which has had nearly 2 million views on YouTube shows Suge Knight joking around with a man that looks a lot like Tupac, whilst in Cuba. However the clip only shows the back of Pac's head."
<p>
<p style="color:red;">"Did Suge Knight plot the murder?
Death Row Records boss Suge Knight was in the car with Tupac when he was shot and some people believe he may have been involved. Although no link has ever been proved, the mogul was charged with murder after allegedly running over two men and killing one following an argument on the set of Tupac movie ‘All Eyez On Me’ in 2015."
